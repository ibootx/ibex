iPhone 3GS 3.1.2 (iBoot-636.66):
================================

    make [TARGET=iPhone2,1/7D11/iBoot]

Two files will be created:
    hooker - pwns iBoot on the fly and creates a new command: "pwn"
    payload - the handler for the newly created command

We can and must use hooker, because this particular iBoot is vulnerable
to the usb_control_msg(0x21, 2) exploit.  Otherwise, we would have to have
a pwned iBoot already on device.

A few numbers about iPhone2,1/7D11/iBoot:
    iBoot Address: 0x4FF00000 => 0x0
    IRQ vector: 0x4FF00038 => 0x38 (gets executed, eventually)
    Load Address: 0x41000000
    USB Exploit: copies 0x2000 bytes from 0x41000000 to 0x0
    Commands: table of { "name", handler, "description" }

In order to keep things simple, we will stash both hooker and payload into the
same iBoot image.  The small hooker occupies a region of zeroes between 0xE0
and 0x200, so it is rebased to 0x4FF00000 + 0xE0.  Because of the USB exploit,
and because we want iBoot to live, payload is rebased to 0x41000000 + 0x2000.

Create iBoot image:
    xpwntool iBoot.n88ap.RELEASE.img3 iboot -iv IV -k KEY
    dd if=iboot of=ibex bs=$[0x2000] count=1
    echo -n -e "\xE0\x00\xF0\x4F" | dd of=ibex bs=1 seek=$[0x38] conv=notrunc
    dd if=hooker of=ibex bs=1 seek=$[0xE0] conv=notrunc
    cat payload >> ibex

Now play with it:
    Put device in Recovery mode.
    ./irecovery -s
    iRecovery> /exploit ibex
    iRecovery> pwn
